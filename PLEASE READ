We can edit the file in github, so we should do all of our stuff in there
and then compile once we think it looks good.

When we make changes we should add a comment (at the bottom when you edit the cpp file) saying what 
has been changed, namely new variables, functions, and stuff like that.

If you have an algorithm idea then make a new file and write it in pseudocode, the same also goes for ideas
about things that the program could/should do.
